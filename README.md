# UFO-Sighting

Data from www.ALIENS-R-REAL.com was used for this exercise. Results were shared on a webpage 

Created a table dynamically based on the dataset collected. The Users can search through the table for specific pieces of information.

### Step 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Created a basic HTML web page 

* Using the UFO dataset wrote code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Used a date form in HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that list for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Step 2: Multiple Search Categories 

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
